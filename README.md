In this project, we aimed to develop a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) algorithm for the accurate detection of
COVID-19 from Chest X-ray (CXR) images.

The challenge was to develop an algorithm that could
accurately detect COVID-19, as well as distinguish between
viral pneumonia, and normal cases based on an input chest
X-ray image.
